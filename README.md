<h1>A/B Tests and Experiments Repository</h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>
Welcome to our A/B Test and Experiments Repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for conducting controlled experiments, A/B tests, and analyzing the results to make data-driven decisions. 
Here, I follow industry best practices and statistical methodologies to ensure rigorous experimentation and obtain meaningful insights.
The datasets used for the tests and experiments are provided by different sources. In the beginning of each experiment notebook, you can find the link to the resource.
